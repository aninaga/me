    <h5>I am an aspiring developer who has experience in HTML & CSS, Javascript, Python, C++ and many more languages. Currently I am attempting to improve my Web Development skills as well as get get further into Machine Learning. I believe ML is our future, which is why I want to explore it. I attend Dublin High School and am part of many clubs in school. Some include Key Club, DECA, and many more. Outside of school I play tennis regularly. I attend competitions often and play on the school team. One day, I aspire to go to a high level University and major in Computer Science, and possibly double major in Buissness as well. It is a dream of mine to help make our world a better place, and I believe going into technology and computer science is a step in the right direction for me. Scroll down for the rest of my website and to learn more about me and some of the projects I have done. </h5>
